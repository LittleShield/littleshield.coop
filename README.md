## Working Together, Not Competing

We want to be completely transparent about our relationship with organizations like Let's Encrypt. We're not in competition with them or other open source software providers – we're a separate entity working to complement their efforts.

Let's Encrypt and similar projects have revolutionized web security by making SSL certificates freely available to everyone. We're deeply grateful for their work and the foundation they've provided for secure internet communication. Our role is to help organizations that might not otherwise have access to professional SSL support, particularly those aligned with cooperative values.

We're here because we believe in the power of community-driven solutions, and we're committed to supporting the cooperative movement through practical, accessible security services.
